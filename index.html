    <p> In-camera is much better than Photoshop DoF in my opinion. It’s because in-camera makes it a learning experiences while in photoshop, you just use technology to make it. Photoshop DoF makes it easier to create a blurry effect and change how blurry affects the shadow and lighting. I feel like the in-camera makes it look more realistic than the photoshop. The photoshop makes it little out of place for the shadow and lighting part of it. In-camera makes you understand the camera more from the aperture and more while on photoshop, you can take a random photograph and use ai and online tools to change how the photo look like.</p>

    <p> In-camera has few settings to change to get what you needed while photoshop has lot of tools that you need to figure out by watching or go through all the possible tools they have to get what you needed.  In-camera makes you understand about the camera/settings. In my opinion, it gives a feel of what you want on that picture so you have less time having to brainstorm what you want to have on it. </p>

    <p> I hope to grain from this homework is the knowledge of using a camera and the work you see from things that you never did for photos until you were there. Camera Raw is basically a tool that enhances the light, shadow and shade to increase the detail or to highlight it. You also can crop it from the Camera Raw. You can also change how the photo is shaped/moved but I don’t really know much about it since we didn’t use that function of Camera Raw Filter. </p>
