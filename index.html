  <h1> Emily's Reflection #3 </h1>
  <body>
    <p> My experience when taking a picture of shallow and deep depth of field photos was that I didn’t know what I was doing but I played around and got some good pictures from background being blurry to the object being blurry and etc. It was fun and not bad as I thought would be since I didn’t know what I was doing. It was hard to find anything to take a picture of since we can’t go too far from the classroom or we will miss what we are going to do for homework. I would love to take more photos again and I love how my professor is very helpful and amazing.</p>

    <p> Photoshop in my experience is still some foreign thing that I don’t know how/what to use it but after watching the video, I get how to use field blur now. The challenges I face during taking a photo was how to make the camera in a certain settings like for example, I’m confused on how to make the camera be blurry of the object and not the background or like how to make the object sharp and background not blurry. I learned that the more time, you have the camera, the more you become the camera and you see inspires really easily.</p>
    <br>
    <p> It makes you understand and want to see what you want on that picture so you have less time having brainstorm what you want to have. I hope to grain from this homework is the knowledge of using a camera and the work you see from things that you never did for photos until you were there.
